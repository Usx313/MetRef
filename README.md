This is an ongoing research project investigating the online processing of referential metaphors, predicative metaphors, and metonymys.  
The repository contains:
- **Experimental stimuli** used in self-paced reading and eye-tracking studies.
- **Raw and processed data files** for analysis.
- **R and Python scripts** for statistical and computational analyses.

## Research Overview
Language is inherently creative, allowing speakers to communicate meaning beyond the literal interpretation of words.  
This project explores two figurative uses—**metaphor and metonymy**—focusing on their distinct communicative roles: **referring** to entities and **predicating** properties.

### **Examples**
- **Metaphor (Predicating):** “Mary is a wilting violet.”
- **Metaphor (Referring):** “The wilting violet hardly said a word.”
- **Metonymy (Predicating):** “She married a pinstripe suit.”
- **Metonymy (Referring):** “The pinstripe suit is a very nice man.”

## **Research Questions**
1. **Do metaphors and metonymies impose different processing costs depending on whether they are used referentially or predicatively?**
2. **Are metaphors more naturally suited for predication, while metonymies are more effective for reference?**
3. **How do the cognitive demands of metaphorical and metonymic usage shape their role in communication?**

## **Why is This Important?**
Understanding figurative language processing provides insights into **cognitive mechanisms underlying meaning construction**.  
Our findings have implications for **linguistic theory, psycholinguistics, models of human communication**, and **natural language processing (NLP)**.

## **Methodology**
We employ **self-paced reading and eye-tracking** experiments to measure real-time comprehension effort.  
By analyzing gaze patterns and reaction times, we pinpoint **where and why processing difficulties arise**.
